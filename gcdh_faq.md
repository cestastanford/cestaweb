**GENERAL QUESTIONS:**

**Who can apply to the program?**

- The program is currently limited to students currently enrolled in a graduate program at Stanford. We may open up the program to outside participants at a later date.

**How long is the program?**

- Typically two years, but may vary based on each student’s particular situation. The maximum time for completing the certificate is four years.

**I have no digital humanities experience at all. Should I apply if I am interested?**

- By all mean, yes. One of the main goals of the program is to provide digital humanities experience, knowledge, and tools to future graduates. Both core and elective courses are designed to both introduce students who have no prior experience with digital scholarship, as well as provide opportunities for students who have worked in the digital humanities with outlets for more advanced work.

**Will I produce a final product?**

- Yes, you are expected to produce an e-portfolio project by the end of the certificate program, which will either be your own independent research project or a clearly defined contribution to an existing CESTA project.

**Will anything show up on my transcript?**

- No, Stanford does not indicate certificates on transcripts. You will, however, receive a certificate of completion signed by both the CESTA Director and your home department Chair. You will also be listed on the CESTA website as having completed the program.

**COURSE REQUIREMENTS:**

**How many courses will I have to take?**

- You must take one approved core course for a letter grade and one approved elective, or two approved core courses. Electives must be approved in advance by the GCDH committee and may be taken pass/fail.

**Do the courses have to be taken in a particular order?**

-No. You may take either the elective or core course first and you may begin work on the required project at any point during your participation in the certificate program.

**Can I apply courses that I have already taken toward the certificate?**
- Yes. You can submit courses that you have taken to the GCDH committee for approval as either a core course (if taken prior to the 2014-2015 academic year) or an elective course (which can be taken at any time).

**Can I suggest an elective course for approval?**

- Yes. You may submit elective courses suggestions to the GCDH committee for approval.

**Do you know what quarters, days, and times the core classes are being offered next year? Is it the same as previous years?**

- Please note that final details for scheduling these courses for the coming 2014-15 academic year are still in progress in the respective home departments. We can provide, however, the current projected info:
Spatial History (HIST 401a) - still TBD, but is usually in winter or spring quarter
Literary Lab (ENG 303C) will be in Winter Quarter 2015, on either a Wednesday or Thursday afternoon
Humanities + Design (DLCL 202) will likely not be taught in the coming 2014-15 year, but will be offered again the following year.

**LAB PROJECT**

**Who will be my advisor for the independent lab project?**

- Your project will need to be evaluated and approved by an Academic Council supervisor (who does not need to be a member of CESTA), and it must also be accepted as an affiliated project on one of CESTA's labs (this approval is given by the director of the lab).

**I have my own project that I want to pursue. How do I decide what CESTA lab my project will be affiliated with?**

-The GCDH committee will be available to discuss your project with you once you have formulated your ideas. They will work with both you and the heads of the various labs to find the best fit for your project.

**How will the independent lab project be evaluated?**

- Evaluation will be done in consultation with your supervisor and be based upon your work during your participation in the project, your final e-portfolio, and the presentation of your work during the yearly GCDH colloquium.

**What is the GCDH Colloquium?**

- At the end of each academic year, CESTA will host a half-day colloquium with invited scholars from the Digital Humanities community both from inside and outside of Stanford. Students who have completed their work on the GCDH will demonstrate their work to their fellow GCDH members, members of CESTA, the student’s Academic Council supervisor, and the invited guests in a 20 minute presentation. This will give you the opportunity to not only show off your work on the project, but will also allow you to meet other member of the DH community.
