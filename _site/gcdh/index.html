<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>The Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities (GCDH) meets a growing need among
the humanities for training in digital methods by leveraging existing resources
at Stanford University.  The GCDH program will draw upon the community of
expertise in the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (CESTA).  Over the past
several years, dozens of graduate students have taken classes taught by CESTA
affiliated faculty and postdoctoral fellows, and participated in workshops and
seminars sponsored by CESTA. The CESTA Graduate Certificate in Digital
Humanities offers a formal structure for this activity and allows graduate
students to acquire and deepen their technical and conceptual skills as well as
to strengthen their position in the competitive job market within and beyond the
academy.</p>

<p>The GCDH seeks to strike a balance between the cultivation of technical skills
and their practical application within project-based Digital Humanities
research.  The program is meant to be relatively lightweight in terms of
specific requirements and flexible as to content and timing in order to best
support the work students are doing in their home departments.  Core classes and
exposure to the CESTA research community will ensure that students leave the
program with solid skills and the experience of learning in a cohort
environment.</p>

<p>Completion of the program will result in both a Certificate, signed by the CESTA
Director and the Chair of the doctoral student’s home department, and, through
the program, the student will also develop a digital portfolio suitable for the
job market.</p>

<h3 id="pilot-plan-gcdh-2014-2017">Pilot Plan: GCDH 2014-2017</h3>

<p><strong>Course work</strong></p>

<p>Students wishing to take part in the first cohort starting in 2014-15 and
thereafter will be expected to complete one GCDH-approved graduate core course
for a letter grade, and one additional approved elective course.  The approved
core courses for the first year of the program are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Spatial History (HIST 401A)</li>
  <li>Literary Lab (ENG 303C)</li>
  <li>Humanities+Design (CLASSICS 396, DLCL 396, HISTORY 336E)</li>
</ul>

<p>Students who have completed any of the core courses, or equivalent courses
taught by members of the program, in past years are eligible to move forward to
the next step in the GCDH program.</p>

<p>Following or concurrent with the completion of the required core course,
students must complete the following two certificate components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Additional coursework (1 or more classes, may be taken pass/fail, must be
approved in advance by the committee in charge) in computer science, information
design, statistics, network analysis, linguistics, or other fields approved by
the student’s supervisor and the CESTA committee in charge. A list of course
recommendations is forthcoming.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Independent research project and portfolio including a finished project
which will be evaluated and approved by both an Academic Council supervisor and
be accepted as an affiliated project in one of CESTA’s labs.  The duration of
such projects must be a minimum of 1 academic quarter. Students may take up to
5 units of credit as directed reading for the purpose of completing the
independent research project.  Final projects will be included in the student’s
e-portfolio and published on the CESTA website.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>or</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Supervised collaborative research in a CESTA lab with the expectation that the
student’s participation culminates in a DH product substantially of the
authorship of the student—2 quarters minimum duration. The student’s portion of
the research will be included in the e-portfolio and published on the CESTA
website.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Staffing:</strong></p>

<p>The GCDH program is staffed primarily by CESTA. Core faculty include Mark
Algee-Hewitt, Franco Moretti, Richard White, Dan Edelstein, Paula Findlen,
Giovanna Ceserani, Walter Scheidel, Elaine Treharne, Amir Eschel, and Zephyr
Frank. Affiliated CESTA faculty include Allyson Hobbs, Edith Scheffer, Caroline
Winterer, Mark McGurl, Ana Minian, and Mikael Wolfe.</p>

<p>Technical expertise is provided by CESTA staff members and the extended CESTA
community. Included in this group are the following: Celena Allen (GIS), Erik
Steiner (visualization design and cartography), Ryan Heuser (programming),
Nicole Coleman (information design and visualization), and Jason Heppler
(digital history). Beyond the core staff and affiliates, the program will draw
upon the expertise of Elijah Meeks (information design) and Karl Grossner
(information design and cartography).</p>

<p><strong>To Apply:</strong></p>

<p>Admission to the program is on a rolling basis, and students may apply at any
time. Please submit a letter of interest and any supporting information to CESTA

<h1 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h3 id="general-questions">GENERAL QUESTIONS</h3>

<p><strong>Who can apply to the program?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The program is currently limited to students currently enrolled in a graduate program at Stanford. We may open up the program to outside participants at a later date.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How long is the program?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Typically two years, but may vary based on each student’s particular situation. The maximum time for completing the certificate is four years.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>I have no digital humanities experience at all. Should I apply if I am interested?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>By all mean, yes. One of the main goals of the program is to provide digital humanities experience, knowledge, and tools to future graduates. Both core and elective courses are designed to both introduce students who have no prior experience with digital scholarship, as well as provide opportunities for students who have worked in the digital humanities with outlets for more advanced work.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will I produce a final product?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes, you are expected to produce an e-portfolio project by the end of the certificate program, which will either be your own independent research project or a clearly defined contribution to an existing CESTA project.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Will anything show up on my transcript?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>No, Stanford does not indicate certificates on transcripts. You will, however, receive a certificate of completion signed by both the CESTA Director and your home department Chair. You will also be listed on the CESTA website as having completed the program.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="course-requirements">COURSE REQUIREMENTS</h3>

<p><strong>How many courses will I have to take?</strong></p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Do the courses have to be taken in a particular order?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>No. You may take either the elective or core course first and you may begin work on the required project at any point during your participation in the certificate program.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Can I apply courses that I have already taken toward the certificate?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes. You can submit courses that you have taken to the GCDH committee for approval as either a core course (if taken prior to the 2014-2015 academic year) or an elective course (which can be taken at any time).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Can I suggest an elective course for approval?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes. You may submit elective courses suggestions to the GCDH committee for approval.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Please note that final details for scheduling these courses for the coming 2014-15 academic year are still in progress in the respective home departments. We can provide, however, the current projected info:
Spatial History (HIST 401a) - still TBD, but is usually in winter or spring quarter
Literary Lab (ENG 303C) will be in Winter Quarter 2015, on either a Wednesday or Thursday afternoon, Humanities+Design (CLASSICS 396, DLCL 396, HISTORY 336E) will be offered in the Fall on Tuesdays in AY 2014-15.”.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="lab-project">LAB PROJECT</h3>

<p><strong>Who will be my advisor for the independent lab project?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Your project will need to be evaluated and approved by an Academic Council supervisor (who does not need to be a member of CESTA), and it must also be accepted as an affiliated project on one of CESTA’s labs (this approval is given by the director of the lab).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>I have my own project that I want to pursue. How do I decide what CESTA lab my project will be affiliated with?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The GCDH committee will be available to discuss your project with you once you have formulated your ideas. They will work with both you and the heads of the various labs to find the best fit for your project.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How will the independent lab project be evaluated?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Evaluation will be done in consultation with your supervisor and be based upon your work during your participation in the project, your final e-portfolio, and the presentation of your work during the yearly GCDH colloquium.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What is the GCDH Colloquium?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>At the end of each academic year, CESTA will host a half-day colloquium with invited scholars from the Digital Humanities community both from inside and outside of Stanford. Students who have completed their work on the GCDH will demonstrate their work to their fellow GCDH members, members of CESTA, the student’s Academic Council supervisor, and the invited guests in a 20 minute presentation. This will give you the opportunity to not only show off your work on the project, but will also allow you to meet other member of the DH community.</li>
