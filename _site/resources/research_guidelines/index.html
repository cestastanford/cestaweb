    <h1 id="what-to-expect-working-at-cesta">What to expect working at CESTA</h1>

<h3 id="who-we-are">Who We Are</h3>

<p>CESTA is an open and collaborative work environment that is home to the Spatial History Project, the Literary Lab, and Humanities + Design, among other initiatives. We work with faculty, graduate students, and postdocs from Stanford and across the country on a variety of research projects. We welcome students of all undergraduate class levels, skill sets, and major backgrounds to collaborate with us on these projects.</p>

<h3 id="our-goals-for-research-assistants">Our Goals for Research Assistants</h3>

<h4 id="space">Space</h4>

<p>We want students to feel comfortable in our space to share their own ideas and research questions. Our open work environment allows stimulating interaction between students, researchers, and staff and fosters a sense of community. The lab space is used for working on the research projects that each student is assigned to, but we also allow students to use the space and technology to work on their own personal projects, assignments, etc. Research assistants are given 24/7 access to the lab.</p>

<h4 id="experience">Experience</h4>

<p>It is important to us that students feel intellectually stimulated and personally engaged when working on a project, so we work hard to match students with projects that fit their interests and skill sets. Another important goal for us is to provide students with an opportunity to learn new technologies, gain insight on different research topics, and gain valuable work experience in a professional, collaborative environment. Research assistants are considered peer collaborators on projects and are encouraged to take ownership of their contributions as co-authors and actively pursue opportunities to publish or present their work. Our lab is often used as a reference for future employment checks when students move on from Stanford.</p>

<h4 id="something-to-take-away">Something to Take Away</h4>

<p>We try our best to identify meaningful ‘deliverables’ that students can take away from this experience. Examples of what former students have taken away include visualizations, publications, articles, maps, posters, new software skills, or soft skills in teamwork and communication. These are all things that we encourage our students to pursue and help guide them along the way.</p>

<p>In order to achieve all of these goals, there are basic expectations of the Research Assistants that are critical to a productive environment. </p>

<h3 id="what-is-expected-of-research-assistants">What is Expected of Research Assistants</h3>

<p>This is applicable to ALL students, including returning RAs. Please read carefully for new changes.</p>

<h4 id="working-hours">Working Hours</h4>

<ul>
  <li>RAs are required to work the established amount of hours for the duration of the hire term, not to exceed the limits set by Stanford policies. It is critical that each student clearly establish an agreed upon work schedule with the project lead. We understand if you have doctors appointments, emergencies, or other responsibilities, but please make sure to let Matt or Celena know when you are unable to make your scheduled day and time. </li>
  <li>Outside Obligations - We understand that students have many obligations and interests outside of their position in the lab and we strive to be as flexible as possible to accommodate those needs, but it is critical that the students maintain open and direct communication with their lead research and lab staff when these obligations come up. We value you being open, honest and direct; it isn’t a productive relationship for either the student or the research team if the student is stretching too much meet their obligations. Resist the urge to oversell your availability!</li>
  <li>
    <p>Working Remotely - Students are expected to complete all work in the lab unless approved the project lead and by either Matt Bryant or Celena Allen. This is not so much a requirement in order to be monitored, but instead is needed in order for the student to fully engage with the project, their peers, and the CESTA lab environment in general. This also allows for collaborative trouble-shooting of technical issues, brainstorming, and to be exposed to new ideas and tools being used around you.</p>
  </li>
  <li><em>Exceptions - Special cases may arise in which these guidelines need to be tailored to a specific situation, and these can be coordinated with Celena and Matt.</em></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="weekly-hours-form">Weekly Hours Form:</h4>

<p>All research assistants are expected to fill out a form of their hours worked weekly. This will be done through a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ezC8A39ZSugFBAHpGviYMQHhMHxZbkYWdk9j0UNzJ24/viewform?usp=send_form">Google Form</a>. Everyone is expected to complete the weekly form even if you worked zero hours. The link to the form will be sent via email and available on the CESTA website.</p>

<h4 id="weekly-journaling">Weekly Journaling:</h4>

<p>Research assistants will compose weekly journal entries to reflect on their progress, track important project challenges and milestones, identify ways to best prioritize time commitment, and plan ahead for future work. The form responses will also be a key way to communicate with lead researchers and provide continuity through a project’s lifespan. Journal entries are not a student evaluation tool; resist the urge to be overly self-critical or demonstrative – focus on the project, not yourself. The length of entries should be more than 25 and less than 100 words. </p>

<h4 id="communication">Communication:</h4>

<p>It cannot be stressed enough how important it is that you are in very frequent communication with your project leader, peers, and other lab staff. Beyond clearly establishing your weekly work schedule and reporting any absence, it is up to your project leader to establish a meeting frequency to discuss your tasks and progress on the research project for which you are involved.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>During the school year</em> please share with your research lead your schedule of availability and establish regular to semi-regular work days</li>
  <li><em>During the summer</em> it is a good idea to meet with your project leaders on a at least a weekly basis</li>
  <li>Some researchers will be off campus and you may need to meet virtually (see Matt, Celena, or Gabe if you need help with this)</li>
  <li>Some good communication practices include: responding to the Google form weekly, frequent use of concise emails, prompt responsiveness to inquiries, accessibility by phone or video when working remotely, preparedness for meetings with materials to review or discuss, note-taking during meetings, summarizing communications post-meeting, and an eye towards project documentation <em>especially during periods of high productivity</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="academic-quarters-10-weeks-each">Academic Quarters (10 Weeks Each):</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Students are expected to work an absolute <strong><em>minimum</em></strong> of three hours per week <strong>or</strong> thirty hours per quarter during the academic school year (3 hours per week x 10 weeks)</li>
  <li>Students can work in CESTA for up to 10 hours total per week during any one academic quarter.</li>
  <li>Hours cannot exceed 8 in an given day, and there must be at least a half hour break every four hours of work performed</li>
  <li>Students are not allowed to charge time on official campus holidays</li>
  <li>If the student has another paid job on campus, the total hours worked each week across both jobs cannot exceed 15 hours</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="summer-session-10-weeks">Summer Session (10 Weeks):</h4>

<ul>
  <li>If you are receiving a full-time stipend, you will be required to work 40hrs/wk  or 400 hours total by the end of the summer session. Arrangements can be made for you to flex your time slightly due to other obligations, but students are expected to complete the full 400 hours before the start of the Fall term.</li>
  <li>If you are receiving a half-time stipend, you will be required to work 20hrs/wk (200 hours total), or full time for half of the summer (40hrs/wk for 5 weeks)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="hourly-temp-contingent-employees">Hourly Temp (Contingent) Employees:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Weekly hours are set upon hire, and are not to be exceeded. Hourly temp employees fill out time cards just like student workers do</li>
  <li>You are expected to fill out your timecard on time</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="time-cards">Time Cards:</h4>

<p>All Research Assistants who are getting paid hours vs. receiving a stipend and Hourly Temp employees are expected to fill out their time cards <strong><em>by the due date and time</em></strong>. You will receive an email from Michelle Lodwick (mlodwick@stanford.edu) every pay period with details about when and how to submit your timecards.</p>

<h4 id="accountability">Accountability</h4>

<p>If you are unable to attend work for prolonged periods of time (more than 3 days) for <strong><em>any</em></strong> reason you must notify your project leader and lab staff (Matt, Celena) through email, phone, or text. If you do not show up for work without explanation, <strong>or</strong> if you do not respond to emails from your project leader or key lab staff for extended periods of time, you will be asked to meet with us to explain and resolve the situation. If this behavior is repeated, we will discuss the continuation of employment with CESTA. We expect students to be responsible employees who have committed to working in CESTA. You are a member of a community that relies on and is committed to you.  ‘Going off the radar’ only causes frustration and slows progress on the research. You are encouraged to talk to us anytime you are having trouble finding the time to work in the lab, or have other concerns about the lab environment.</p>
